This is a Javascript project that uses Node.js and Node GUI. 
This project was also built on Windows, but the OS should not matter. Node GUI is cross-platform

Requirements for project:
- CMake 3.1 or higher: https://cmake.org/install/
- Node.js 12 or higher
- Visual Studio
- A good Javascript editor, such as Visual Studio Code.

Once you have CMake and Node installed, navigate to this folder in your command line and run:

npm install

Once that command has finished, run:

npm start

The calculator will appear on your screen and you can use it!
